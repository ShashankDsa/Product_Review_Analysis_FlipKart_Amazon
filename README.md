Problem Statement:
Customer reviews & feedback are crucial for any product in the market. Product reviews & feedback from customers play a pivotal role in enriching the product's quality & alongside meet the market expectations. It is easy for any seller to get reviews through one-one conversations with customers if the product is sold in offline stores, but it is difficult to retrieve & analyse the same reviews if the same product is sold online.
E-commerce is one of the booming industries & is a one-stop destination for various sellers to market & sell their products online to attract a larger market. Given a set of customer reviews of each category (camera, battery, display, value for money, performance) for a mobile that is live on an e-commerce platform like (Flipkart/Amazon. etc): 
1) Categorize & analyse the reviews to calculate the percentage of positive & negative reviews.
2) Calculate the total rating on a scale of 5 for each category.
3)Create a Ranking table for each Mobile phone based on each category and overall ranking.

Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Use Natural Language Processing for analysing the reviews.

Results:
Develop a machine learning model to analyse & calculate the percentage of positive & negative reviews. Model should also result in a total rating score on a scale of 5.
